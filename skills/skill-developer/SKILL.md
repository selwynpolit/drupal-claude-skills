# Skill Developer Guide

## Purpose

Comprehensive guide for creating and managing skills in Claude Code, following the **[Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)** and Anthropic's best practices including the 500-line rule and progressive disclosure pattern.

## Agent Skills Specification (agentskills.io)

Skills in this project follow the open **[Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)**. Key requirements:

### Directory Structure

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md           # Required - main skill file
├── references/        # Optional - detailed documentation
├── scripts/           # Optional - executable code (Python, Bash, JS)
└── assets/            # Optional - templates, images, data files
```

### SKILL.md Frontmatter Schema

**Required Fields:**
| Field | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, must match directory name |
| `description` | 1-1024 chars, include keywords for agent activation |

**Optional Fields:**
| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `license` | License for sharing skills publicly |
| `compatibility` | Environment requirements (packages, network access) |
| `metadata` | Key-value pairs for custom properties |
| `allowed-tools` | Pre-approved tools list (experimental) |

### Progressive Disclosure Model

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens) - loads at startup
2. **Full instructions** (<5000 tokens recommended) - loads on activation
3. **Supporting files** - loads as needed

### Validation

Use `skills-ref` tool or validate manually:
- File must be named `SKILL.md` (uppercase)
- Name in frontmatter must match parent directory
- Description should include trigger keywords

## When to Use This Skill

Automatically activates when you mention:
- Creating or adding skills
- Modifying skill triggers or rules
- Understanding how skill activation works
- Debugging skill activation issues
- Claude Code best practices
- Progressive disclosure
- YAML frontmatter
- 500-line rule

---

## System Overview

### Skill Activation Approaches

There are several approaches to skill activation, from simple to advanced:

**1. Description-Based Activation (Default)**
- Claude reads skill descriptions from frontmatter at session start
- Activates skills when user prompts match description keywords
- No additional configuration needed
- Works out of the box with the agentskills.io spec

**2. Example Implementation: Hook-Based Activation**

For more sophisticated activation, you can build a hook system. This is an advanced pattern:

**UserPromptSubmit Hook** (Proactive Suggestions)
- Trigger: BEFORE Claude sees user's prompt
- Purpose: Suggest relevant skills based on keywords + intent patterns
- Method: Injects formatted reminder as context (stdout to Claude's input)

**Stop Hook** (Gentle Reminders)
- Trigger: AFTER Claude finishes responding
- Purpose: Gentle reminder to self-assess patterns in code written
- Method: Analyzes edited files for patterns, displays reminder if needed

**Configuration for Hook Systems:**

A rules file (e.g., `skill-rules.json`) can define:
- All skills and their trigger conditions
- Enforcement levels (block, suggest, warn)
- File path patterns (glob)
- Content detection patterns (regex)
- Skip conditions (session tracking, file markers, env vars)

## Skill Types

### 1. Guardrail Skills

**Purpose:** Enforce critical best practices that prevent errors

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"guardrail"`
- Enforcement: `"block"`
- Priority: `"critical"` or `"high"`
- Block file edits until skill used
- Prevent common mistakes
- Session-aware (don't repeat nag in same session)

**Examples:**
- `database-verification` - Verify table/column names before queries
- `frontend-dev-guidelines` - Enforce React/TypeScript patterns

**When to Use:**
- Mistakes that cause runtime errors
- Data integrity concerns
- Critical compatibility issues

### 2. Domain Skills

**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive guidance for specific areas

**Characteristics:**
- Type: `"domain"`
- Enforcement: `"suggest"`
- Priority: `"high"` or `"medium"`
- Advisory, not mandatory
- Topic or domain-specific
- Comprehensive documentation

**Examples:**
- `backend-dev-guidelines` - Node.js/Express/TypeScript patterns
- `frontend-dev-guidelines` - React/TypeScript best practices
- `drupal-search-api` - Search API configuration guidance

**When to Use:**
- Complex systems requiring deep knowledge
- Best practices documentation
- Architectural patterns
- How-to guides

## Quick Start: Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Create Skill File

**Location:** `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description including keywords that trigger this skill. Mention topics, file types, and use cases. Be explicit about trigger terms.
---

# My New Skill

## Purpose
What this skill helps with

## When to Use
Specific scenarios and conditions

## Key Information
The actual guidance, documentation, patterns, examples
```

**Best Practices (per agentskills.io spec):**
- **Name**: 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, must match directory name
- **Description**: 1-1024 chars, include ALL trigger keywords/phrases
- **Content**: Under 500 lines - use `references/` directory for details
- **Examples**: Real code examples
- **Structure**: Clear headings, lists, code blocks

### Step 2: (Optional) Add Trigger Rules

If using a hook-based activation system, add rules:

**Basic Template:**
```json
{
  "my-new-skill": {
    "type": "domain",
    "enforcement": "suggest",
    "priority": "medium",
    "promptTriggers": {
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "intentPatterns": ["(create|add).*?something"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Test Activation

Verify your skill activates correctly:
- Try prompts that should trigger it
- Try prompts that should NOT trigger it
- Refine description keywords based on results

### Step 4: Follow Anthropic Best Practices

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use progressive disclosure with reference files
- Add table of contents to reference files > 100 lines
- Write detailed description with trigger keywords
- Test with 3+ real scenarios before documenting
- Iterate based on actual usage

---

## Enforcement Levels

### BLOCK (Critical Guardrails)

- Physically prevents Edit/Write tool execution
- Claude sees message and must use skill to proceed
- **Use For**: Critical mistakes, data integrity, security issues

**Example:** Database column name verification

### SUGGEST (Recommended)

- Reminder injected before Claude sees prompt
- Claude is aware of relevant skills
- Not enforced, just advisory
- **Use For**: Domain guidance, best practices, how-to guides

**Example:** Frontend development guidelines

### WARN (Optional)

- Low priority suggestions
- Advisory only, minimal enforcement
- **Use For**: Nice-to-have suggestions, informational reminders

**Rarely used** - most skills are either BLOCK or SUGGEST.

---

## Skip Conditions & User Control

### 1. Session Tracking

**Purpose:** Don't nag repeatedly in same session

**How it works:**
- First edit: Hook blocks, updates session state
- Second edit (same session): Hook allows
- Different session: Blocks again

### 2. File Markers

**Purpose:** Permanent skip for verified files

**Marker:** `// @skip-validation`

**Usage:**
```typescript
// @skip-validation
import { PrismaService } from './prisma';
// This file has been manually verified
```

**NOTE:** Use sparingly - defeats the purpose if overused

### 3. Environment Variables

**Purpose:** Emergency disable, temporary override

**Global disable:**
```bash
export SKIP_SKILL_GUARDRAILS=true  # Disables ALL blocks
```

**Skill-specific:**
```bash
export SKIP_DB_VERIFICATION=true
```

## Testing Checklist

When creating a new skill, verify:

- [ ] Skill file created in `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Proper frontmatter with name and description
- [ ] Keywords tested with real prompts
- [ ] No false positives in testing
- [ ] No false negatives in testing
- [ ] **SKILL.md under 500 lines**
- [ ] Reference files created if needed
- [ ] Table of contents added to files > 100 lines

---

## Advanced Topics

For teams building sophisticated activation systems, consider:

- **Trigger types**: Keywords, intent patterns, file path globs, content regex
- **Hook mechanisms**: UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, Stop event hooks
- **Session state management**: Tracking which skills have been acknowledged
- **Performance**: Keep hook execution under 200ms
- **Pattern libraries**: Reusable regex and glob patterns

These topics are documented in optional reference files:
- `TRIGGER_TYPES.md` - Complete trigger type guide
- `SKILL_RULES_REFERENCE.md` - Rules schema documentation
- `HOOK_MECHANISMS.md` - Hook internals deep dive
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Debugging activation issues
- `PATTERNS_LIBRARY.md` - Ready-to-use pattern collection

## Quick Reference Summary

### Create New Skill (4 Steps)

1. Create `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` with frontmatter
2. Test activation with real prompts
3. Refine description keywords based on testing
4. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines

### Trigger Types

- **Keywords**: Explicit topic mentions (in description)
- **Intent**: Implicit action detection (advanced, via hooks)
- **File Paths**: Location-based activation (advanced, via hooks)
- **Content**: Technology-specific detection (advanced, via hooks)

### Enforcement

- **BLOCK**: Critical only, prevents tool execution
- **SUGGEST**: Most common, advisory context injection
- **WARN**: Advisory, rarely used

### Skip Conditions

- **Session tracking**: Automatic (prevents repeated nags)
- **File markers**: `// @skip-validation` (permanent skip)
- **Env vars**: `SKIP_SKILL_GUARDRAILS` (emergency disable)

### Anthropic Best Practices & agentskills.io Spec

- **500-line rule**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- **Progressive disclosure**: Use `references/` directory for detailed docs
- **Table of contents**: Add to reference files > 100 lines
- **One level deep**: Don't nest references deeply
- **Rich descriptions**: Include all trigger keywords (max 1024 chars per spec)
- **Name = Directory**: Skill name in frontmatter must match parent directory
- **Test first**: Build 3+ evaluations before extensive documentation
- **Spec URL**: https://agentskills.io/specification

### Troubleshoot

Test skill activation by trying prompts that should and should not trigger the skill. Refine description keywords iteratively.
