# Canvas Contribution Workflow

> **Web root:** Examples use `docroot/` (the web root Acquia Cloud requires). If your project uses the Composer `drupal/recommended-project` default, the web root is `web/` — substitute it in the paths below (other setups may use `html/`, `public_html/`, or the project root). Check the `docroot:` key in `.ddev/config.yaml` if unsure.

This skill extends the general `drupal-contrib-mgmt` skill with Canvas-specific details.

For the general drupal.org contribution workflow (issue creation, issue forks, commit format, HTML formatting), see the **drupal-contrib-mgmt** skill.

## Canvas-Specific Setup

### Repository Structure

- **Canvas Contrib Repo**: `~/Sites/canvas-contrib/`
- **GG App Repo**: `~/Sites/myproject/`

### Initial Clone (One-Time)

```bash
cd ~/Sites
git clone git@git.drupal.org:project/canvas.git canvas-contrib
```

## Canvas UI Development

Canvas has a React-based UI that requires building.

### Build Commands

```bash
cd ~/Sites/canvas-contrib/ui
npm install
npm run lint    # Check for lint errors
npm run lint -- --fix  # Auto-fix lint errors
npm run build   # Build for production
```

### After Applying Patches in GG

```bash
cd ~/Sites/myproject
composer reinstall drupal/canvas
cd docroot/modules/contrib/canvas/ui && npm run build
ddev drush cr
```

## Canvas Issue Fork Example

Using issue #3569725 as an example:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/canvas-contrib

# Add fork remote
git remote add canvas-3569725 git@git.drupal.org:issue/canvas-3569725.git
git fetch canvas-3569725

# Checkout issue branch
git checkout -b '3569725-auto-scale-to-fit' --track canvas-3569725/'3569725-auto-scale-to-fit'

# Make changes, then commit
git add ui/src/path/to/files
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Issue #3569725: Add auto scale-to-fit feature

- Feature detail 1
- Feature detail 2
EOF
)"

# Push
git push canvas-3569725 3569725-auto-scale-to-fit
```
